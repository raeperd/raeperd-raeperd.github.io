# Big-O Notation

All of these issues can multiply runtimes by (large) constants. So measure runtime in a way that ignores constant multiples

Problem
Unfortunately, 1 second, 1 hour, 1 year only differ by constant multiples

- Classifies Growth Rate
- Cleans up Notation
- Can Ignore Complicated Details 

Warning 
- Using Big-O loses important information about constant multiples
- Big-O is only asymptotic
