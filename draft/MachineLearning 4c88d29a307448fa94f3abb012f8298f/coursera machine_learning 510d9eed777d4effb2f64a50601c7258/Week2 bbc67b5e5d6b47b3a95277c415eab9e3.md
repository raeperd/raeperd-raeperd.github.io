NOTE: x_{0} is set to 1 so that transpose of seta and x has same dimension

The training examples are stored in X row-wise, like such:

We can calculate the hypothesis as a column vector of size mx1 with:

# Feature Normalization

We can speed up gradient descent by having each of our input values in roughly the same range. This is because θ will descend quickly on small ranges and slowly on large ranges, and so will oscillate inefficiently down to the optimum when the variables are very uneven.

Two techniques to help with this are **feature scaling** and **mean normalization**. Feature scaling involves dividing the input values by the range (i.e. the maximum value minus the minimum value) of the input variable, resulting in a new range of just 1. Mean normalization involves subtracting the average value for an input variable from the values for that input variable, resulting in a new average value for the input variable of just zero. To implement both of these techniques, adjust your input values as shown in this formula:

# Gradient Descent Tips

**Debugging gradient descent.** Make a plot with *number of iterations* on the x-axis. Now plot the cost function, J(θ) over the number of iterations of gradient descent. If J(θ) ever increases, then you probably need to decrease α. (RECOMMEDED)

**Automatic convergence test.** Declare convergence if J(θ) decreases by less than E in one iteration, where E is some small value such as 10−3. However in practice it's difficult to choose this threshold value.

It has been proven that if learning rate α is sufficiently small, then J(θ) will decrease on every iteration. Andrew Ng recommends decreasing α by multiples of 3.

# Features and Polynomial Regression

We can change the behavior or curve of our hypothesis function by making it a quadratic, cubic or square root function (or any other form).

**Note** that at 2:52 and through 6:22 in the "Features and Polynomial Regression" video, the curve that Prof Ng discusses about "doesn't ever come back down" is in reference to the hypothesis function that uses the sqrt() function

# Normal Equation

The "Normal Equation" is a method of finding the optimum theta without iteration.

## Normal Equation Noninvertibility

if X^T*X may be noninvertible. The common causes are 

- Redundant features, where two features are very closely related (i.e. they are linearly dependent)
- Too many features (e.g. m ≤ n). In this case, delete some features or use "regularization" (to be explained in a later lesson).

Solutions to the above problems include deleting a feature that is linearly dependent with another or deleting one or more features when there are too many features.
