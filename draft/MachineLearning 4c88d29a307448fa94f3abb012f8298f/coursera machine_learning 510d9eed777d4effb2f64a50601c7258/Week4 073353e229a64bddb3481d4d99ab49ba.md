# Week4

# Summary

- Neural Network can represent non-linear decision boundary only with linear operation.
- Everything can be vectorized

# Motivations

- Logistic regression needs a lot features to represent non-linear decision boundary as we set more and more feature
- Neural Network can represent non-linear decision boundary only with linear operation.

# Model Representation

- bias unit == x0 == 1
- activation function == sigmoid function == logistic function
- weights  == parameters

setting x = a^(1), we can rewrite the equation as:

- Each layer gets its own matrix of weights theata^(j)
- If network has sj units in layer j and sj+1 units in layer j+1, then Θ(j) will be of dimension sj+1×(sj+1).
    - +1 comes from the addtion of the bias nodes
    - the output nodes will not include the bias nodes while the inputs will.
- Notice that in this last step, between layer j and layer j+1, we are doing exactly the same thing as we did in logistic regression.
